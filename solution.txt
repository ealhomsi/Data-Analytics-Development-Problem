Hello :) :)

AOV the  average order value is caluclated as the total revenue divided by the #orders. However, after inspetion of the data, I noticed that there 
are two types of customers. Businesses usally requesting in thousands and normal clients requesting in under a dozen.

After splitting the data into B2B and B2C, I have calculated the AOV for both and got the following results:


('AOV of B2B is ', 704000.0)
('AOV of B2C is ', 754.0919125025085)

Seems more reasonable for B2C now.

Thank you for your time and consideration

Sincerely,
